## Introduction

When developing graphical user interfaces (GUIs) with PyQt5, you can design your layout using **Qt Designer** and save the interface as a `.ui` file. To incorporate this design into your Python application, you have two main options:

1. **Convert the `.ui` file into a Python module** using `pyuic5`.
2. **Load the `.ui` file directly at runtime** in your Python code.

This guide will walk you through both methods, including the necessary requirements and how to verify that everything is installed correctly.

## Requirements

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.x**: The programming language.
- **PyQt5**: Python bindings for the Qt application framework.
- **pyuic5**: A command-line tool included with PyQt5 to convert `.ui` files to Python code.
- **Qt Designer**: A visual tool to design your GUI, which outputs `.ui` files.

### Installing Python

1. **Download Python**: Visit the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) and download the latest version for Windows.
2. **Run the Installer**: Double-click the downloaded file and follow the installation prompts.
   - **Important**: Check the box that says **"Add Python 3.x to PATH"** during installation.

### Checking Python Installation

Open **Command Prompt** and run:

```bash
python --version
```

## Option 1: Converting `.ui` Files to Python Modules

In this method, you use `pyuic5` to convert the `.ui` file into a Python script that can be imported into your application.

### Steps:

#### 1. Design Your GUI in Qt Designer

- Open **Qt Designer**.
- Design your interface.
- Save the file as `my_ui.ui`.

#### 2. Convert the `.ui` File to a `.py` File

Open **Command Prompt** and navigate to the directory containing `design.ui`. Run:

```bash
pyuic5 -x my_ui.ui -o my_ui.py
```


## Option 2: Loading `.ui` Files Directly in Python Code

This method involves loading the `.ui` file at runtime using PyQt5's `uic` module.

### Steps:

#### 1. Design Your GUI in Qt Designer

- Open **Qt Designer**.
- Design your interface.
- Save the file as `my_ui.ui`.

#### 2. Load the `.ui` File in Your Python Script (files on the repo)

Create a Python script, e.g., `load_ui.py`, and load the `.ui` file, and include the ui file in the code:
```
import sys
from PyQt5 import QtWidgets, uic

class ExampleApp(QtWidgets.QMainWindow):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        uic.loadUi('design.ui', self)
        # Connect signals and slots here

def main():
    app = QtWidgets.QApplication(sys.argv)
    window = ExampleApp()
    window.show()
    sys.exit(app.exec_())

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```
