## Introduction

When developing graphical user interfaces (GUIs) with PyQt5, you can design your layout using **Qt Designer** and save the interface as a `.ui` file. To incorporate this design into your Python application, you have two main options:

1. **Convert the `.ui` file into a Python module** using `pyuic5`.
2. **Load the `.ui` file directly at runtime** in your Python code.

This guide will walk you through both methods, including the necessary requirements and how to verify that everything is installed correctly.

## Requirements

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.x**: The programming language.
- **PyQt5**: Python bindings for the Qt application framework.
- **pyuic5**: A command-line tool included with PyQt5 to convert `.ui` files to Python code.
- **Qt Designer**: A visual tool to design your GUI, which outputs `.ui` files.

### Installing Python

1. **Download Python**: Visit the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) and download the latest version for Windows.
2. **Run the Installer**: Double-click the downloaded file and follow the installation prompts.
   - **Important**: Check the box that says **"Add Python 3.x to PATH"** during installation.

### Checking Python Installation

Open **Command Prompt** and run:

```bash
python --version
